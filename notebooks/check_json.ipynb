Second sound: A crackling/rustling sound (around 00:02-00:03) - this sounds like paper being crumpled or torn.\\n3. Third sound: A loud ripping/shattering sound (around 00:04-00:06) - this is a tearing sound with a harsh, sharp quality.\\n4. Fourth sound: Another similar loud tearing/shattering sound (around 00:06-00:08) - same as the previous tearing sound.\\n5. Fifth sound: A third similar loud tearing/shattering sound (around 00:08-00:10) - another identical tearing sound.\\n\\nNow I need to analyze which sound is the last one in the sequence.
